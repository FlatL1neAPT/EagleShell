## What is EagleShell?

This tool is focused on optimal experience through pentesting. It contains a lot of scripts for every type of pentest assessment.

Everything inside this tool is helpful, analyzed, tested and there is no misconfigured script. It isn't based on guesses or anything like that, but rather on well-tested scripts.

The tool is often updated with new scripts, new features and it is sometimes rewritten in some parts for a better template. If there is a critical bug, We'll notice it immediately and patch it.
